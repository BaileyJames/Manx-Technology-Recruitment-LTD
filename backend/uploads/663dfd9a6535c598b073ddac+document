Backend developer team has more experience with NoSQL

NoSQL is driven by agile practices, which aligns with our Agile methodology, as NoSQL has a flexible schema model allowing us to change database 
functionality quickly and easily, which is vital as we only have two weeks left to finish this.

The backend web framework is Express, which is JS, and the MongoDB drivers we can use allow us to use the same language instead of using SQL and JS
MongoDB, for instance, can be used entirely within a JavaScript ecosystem.

Quicker for less advanced queries, as we won't have many if any really advanced queries.

For expansion, NoSQL scales horizontally instead of vertically, which results in zero downtime and long-term cost savings compared to vertically scaling
SQL databases. They're also more resilient due to there being backups by default
